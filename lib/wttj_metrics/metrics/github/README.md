## Usage

Calculators are typically instantiated with a collection of PR data and then called to perform the calculation.

```ruby
# Example usage
calculator = WttjMetrics::Metrics::Github::PrVelocityCalculator.new(pull_requests)
metrics = calculator.calculate

puts "Average Time to Merge: #{metrics[:avg_time_to_merge]} hours"
```
